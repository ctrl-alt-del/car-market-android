# Car-Market-Android

This is an demo mobile app that consumes this [API](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/car-market) that I made.

## Setup
For the first time build after pulling or forking this repository, you need to navigate to the root folder of this repository and run `gradle build` to download all the dependencies to your `libs` folder.  Afterwards, you are free to build the project either use gradle or your IDE, such as Eclipse.

If you don't have gradle in you computer yet, you can follow my instruction in [here](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv#gradle) on how to get gradle installed on different operating systems.
