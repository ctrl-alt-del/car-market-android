# Car-Market-Android

This is an demo mobile app that consumes this [API](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/car-market) that I made.

## Setup
**Android SDK**
<br>
First of all, make sure you have the **Android SDK** somewhere in your system.  If you don't have it, you can download it on [Google's developer page](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).  If you need help on setting up the SDK, you can follow the instruction I wrote earlier in [here](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv#sdk).

For the first time build after pulling or forking this repository, you need to navigate to the root folder of this repository and run `gradle build` to download all the dependencies to your `libs` folder.  Afterwards, you are free to build the project either use gradle or your IDE, such as Eclipse.

If you don't have gradle in you computer yet, you can follow my instruction in [here](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv#gradle) on how to get gradle installed on different operating systems.
